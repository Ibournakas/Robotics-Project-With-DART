# Robotics-Project-With-DART
This is a project that we use the simulator DART with some other add-ons and we have a Panda robot try to stuck cubes on top of each other. We do this project by using Robot-DART libraries and Magnum with python. Note that this project contains graphics to show the simulation and so magnum is necessary to see the results.
